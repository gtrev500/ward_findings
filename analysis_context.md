# Analysis Context and Focus

## Geographic Focus
Our analysis is specifically focused on United States data. This geographical limitation allows us to examine the direct impact of US drug policies, particularly the War on Drugs. Future analysis could incorporate data from countries with alternative approaches (such as Canada's partial safe-supply initiatives) for comparative studies.

## Current Data Collection Crisis
As of April 2024, the dataset was frozen due to new policies making it illegal to collect drug samples. This represents a critical public health information gap - with no legal avenues to quantitatively investigate drugs beyond DEA enforcement actions. This policy change effectively eliminates evidence-based early warning systems for dangerous substances in the clandestine supply.

## Contextualization with Broader Evidence
While our primary analysis will rely on the patterns identified in our database, we will contextualize these findings within the larger body of research on:
- Public health impacts of prohibition
- Sociological effects of criminalization
- Historical patterns in drug policy and market responses
- Harm reduction alternatives and their outcomes

Our goal is to connect data-driven observations with established research to create a more comprehensive picture of prohibition's effects.
