# Public Health Impact Analysis Plan

## Overview
This analysis examines patterns in our drug database that illuminate the public health consequences of prohibition policies, particularly focusing on high-risk substances, dangerous combinations, and the efficacy of early warning systems.

## Analysis Components

### 1. High-Risk Substance Trend Analysis
**Question:** How has the prevalence of highly dangerous substances changed over time?

**Implementation:**
- Track the presence of key high-risk substances (fentanyl analogs, heroin, xylazine)
- Analyze yearly trends in their prevalence
- Compare emergence patterns with known policy events
- Identify inflection points in substance prevalence

**Data Source:**
- Drug database with substance composition information
- Test dates spanning from 1996-2024

### 2. Dangerous Combinations Analysis
**Question:** How frequently do particularly lethal combinations of substances appear, and how has this changed over time?

**Implementation:**
- Identify co-occurrence of high-risk substance pairs (fentanyl+xylazine, fentanyl+heroin, etc.)
- Track yearly trends in such combinations
- Analyze the timing of emergence for new dangerous combinations
- Compare with patterns of single-substance samples

**Data Source:**
- Drug samples with multiple detected substances
- Focus on combinations known to increase overdose risk

### 3. Novel Synthetic Opioid Timeline
**Question:** How rapidly do new fentanyl analogs emerge, and what does this indicate about prohibition's effects?

**Implementation:**
- Create a chronological timeline of fentanyl analog first appearances
- Analyze the acceleration in new analog detection over time
- Examine the relationship between scheduling actions and new analog emergence
- Identify patterns in molecular modifications that evade scheduling

**Data Source:**
- First detection dates for each fentanyl analog
- Specific fentanyl variant identification

### 4. Early Warning System Evaluation
**Question:** How effectively does the current drug testing system serve as an early warning mechanism?

**Implementation:**
- Track detection patterns for newly emerged substances
- Analyze the spread from first detection to widespread presence
- Examine the relationship between testing dates and publication dates
- Assess geographical spread patterns for new substances

**Data Source:**
- Detection patterns for key substances of concern
- Monthly detection counts to assess rate of spread

## Expected Outputs

1. Time series data showing the rise of high-risk substances
2. Combination analysis showing increasing polysubstance presence
3. Timeline visualizing the acceleration of novel opioid emergence
4. Detection pattern analysis showing early warning system efficacy

## Analysis Interpretation Framework

This analysis will interpret findings within these contexts:
1. **Overdose Crisis Impact** - How drug supply changes correlate with overdose mortality
2. **Iron Law of Prohibition** - How prohibition drives increasing potency
3. **Information Gap Crisis** - How data collection limitations impact public health response
4. **Polysubstance Risk Escalation** - How prohibition creates increasingly complex and dangerous mixtures

## Methodology Notes

- For substance categorization, we use string matching to identify substance types
- For combination analysis, we focus on specific high-risk pairs known to increase overdose risk
- For early warning analysis, we track spread patterns for key substances of concern
- All findings should be contextualized with broader public health data where possible
